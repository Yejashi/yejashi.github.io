    summary: >
      Thicket is a Python-based toolkit for analyzing ensemble performance data. It is also built on
      top of Hatchet, allowing for the same benefits that Hatchet provides.

      My work on Thicket centers around the Call Path Query Language I created for Hatchet as well
      as general software engineering work.

    summary: >
      Hatchet is a Python library that enables users to analyze performance data generated by
      different HPC profilers. Its main advantage over other tools is that it is capable of
      ingesting data from different profilers into a common representation, allowing users to
      use the same code to analyze performance data from different sources.

      My work on Hatchet centers around the Call Path Query Language, which enables users to filter
      profiles based on caller-callee relationships.

    summary: >
      ANACIN-X is a suite of tools designed for trace-based analysis of non-deterministic behavior in MPI applications, helping developers and scientists identify root sources of non-determinism. It features a framework for characterizing non-determinism through graph similarity, consisting of execution trace collection, event graph construction, kernel analysis, and distance visualization. Additionally, it includes use cases focused on communication patterns to enhance understanding and reproducibility in HPC applications.
