  - name:  Correlating Compiler Optimizations with Runtime Performance
    logo: /images/sections/projects/llvm_logo.jpg
    role: Developer and Researcher
    timeline: "Jan 2024 - Present"
    repo: https://github.com/LLNL/thicket
    summary: >
      This project develops a methodology to connect compiler optimization decisions with runtime performance 
      for performance-portability libraries like RAJA. It integrates compiler optimization data directly into 
      runtime profiles so developers can see how specific optimizations affect execution. We demonstrate the 
      approach using kernels from the RAJA Performance Suite.

    summary: >
      Thicket is a Python-based toolkit for analyzing ensemble performance data. It is also built on
      top of Hatchet, allowing for the same benefits that Hatchet provides.

    repo: https://github.com/LLNL/hatchet
    summary: >
      Hatchet is a Python library that enables users to analyze performance data generated by
      different HPC profilers. Its main advantage over other tools is that it is capable of
      ingesting data from different profilers into a common representation, allowing users to
      use the same code to analyze performance data from different sources.

    timeline: "Oct 2022 - May 2024"
    repo: https://github.com/TauferLab/ANACIN-X
    summary: >
      ANACIN-X is a suite of tools designed for trace-based analysis of non-deterministic behavior in MPI applications, helping developers and scientists identify root sources of non-determinism. It features a framework for characterizing non-determinism through graph similarity, consisting of execution trace collection, event graph construction, kernel analysis, and distance visualization. Additionally, it includes use cases focused on communication patterns to enhance understanding and reproducibility in HPC applications.
