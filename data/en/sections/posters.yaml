      summary: >
        This work focuses on performance portability and proposes a methodological approach to assessing and explaining how different kernels behave across various hardware architectures using the RAJA Performance Suite (RAJAPerf). Our methodology leverages metrics from the Intel top-down pipeline and clustering techniques to sort the kernels based on performance characteristics. We assess the methodology on 54 RAJAPerfâ€™s computational kernels on Intel Xeon and NVIDIA V100 platforms. Our results confirm the effectiveness of our methodology in automatically characterizing performance differentials and speedups, particularly in memory-bound kernels.
